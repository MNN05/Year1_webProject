			<h2>About The Website</h2>
			
			The website is deticated to my amazing mother who
			had struggled with coming to terms of her diagnosis
			,and had a difficult time finding a way to process the 
			information. I want to help people know what they are dealing and 
			hopefully come to terms with it.
