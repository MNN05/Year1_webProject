			Try to not to consume the following foods in big or normal portions:
			<ul>
				<li>Dairy</li>
				<li>Sugary foods</li>
				<li>Carbohydrates</li>
			</ul>

				<li>Tumeric</li>
				<li>Ginger</li>
				<li>And even vegetables</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Unwanted situations</h3>
				RA does not only affect the joints but also other systems such as the breathing and
				cardiovascular systems. During this time, try not to put yourself in danger. To elaborate
				<strong>do not</strong> do excess exercising, doing of chores, climbing, carry heavy objeacts
				and especially do not
				put your self in scary situations.
				<br>
				It is also reccomended to keep surfaces clean and try to avoid becoming sick- catching a cold or 
				having the flu-as it can greatly impact your breathing.
				
			<h3>Exercise</h3>

				</ul>
